# Deliverable4
Build a Java-based application that uses the database that you have created. Provide a simple UI that can be used to enter parameters for the queries and display results from the database. The UI can be a text-only that uses the Command Line Interface (CLI) or a graphic UI or a web application. The application must display a menu and return to that menu after each action without the need to relaunch the application each time
